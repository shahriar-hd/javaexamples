# Amazing numbers
Delving into the Intriguing World of Special Numbers: Armstrong, Automorphic, Peterson, Polindrome, Tech Numbers, and Fibonacci Series.
<br />The realm of numbers is a captivating one, brimming with unique patterns, properties, and fascinating concepts that continue to intrigue mathematicians and enthusiasts worldwide. Among these intriguing number types, the Armstrong, Automorphic, Peterson, Polindrome, Tech Numbers, and Fibonacci Series stand out as particularly fascinating examples.
## Armstrong Numbers: A Celebration of Self-Similarity
Armstrong numbers, also known as narcissistic numbers, possess an intriguing property: they are those positive integers that can be expressed as the sum of their own cubes. For instance, 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153. This self-referential property adds a layer of complexity and intrigue to these numbers.
## Automorphic Numbers: A Touch of Mystery
Automorphic numbers, also known as perfect squares ending in the original number, exhibit an uncanny ability to retain a hint of their identity even when squared. Examples include 25 and 76, whose squares, 625 and 5776, respectively, end with the original number itself. This peculiarity adds a touch of mystery to these numbers.
## Peterson Numbers: A Fusion of Factorials
Peterson numbers, named after mathematician Floyd Peterson, are numbers where the sum of the factorials of their digits equals the original number. For example, 145 is a Peterson number because 1! + 4! + 5! = 145. This interesting property highlights the interconnectedness of the digits within these numbers.
## Polindrome Numbers: A Mirror Image of Identity
Polindrome numbers, also known as palindromes, are those that read the same backward as forward. For instance, 545 and 1221 are polindrome numbers because they retain their identity when reversed. This unique property makes them stand out as numbers with an inherent symmetry.
## Tech Numbers: A Squared Tale of Symmetry
Tech numbers, also known as self-inverse squares, are even-digit numbers where the square of the sum of their left and right halves equals the original number. For example, 2025 satisfies this property because 20+25=45, and 45^2=2025. This interesting property reflects the symmetry within these numbers.
## Fibonacci Series: A Never-Ending Tale of Growth
The Fibonacci series, named after Italian mathematician Leonardo da Pisa, is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The first two numbers are 0 and 1, and subsequent numbers are generated by adding the previous two. This seemingly simple series has remarkable properties and applications in various fields, including mathematics, nature, and art.
<br />This program offers two methods for generating Fibonacci series:
### Printing the Fibonacci sequence from a(1) to a(n):
This method iteratively calculates and prints each Fibonacci number from a(1) to a(n), separated by tab.
<br />Key Formula: a(n) = a(n-1) + a(n-2), where a(1) = 1 and a(2) = 1.
### Printing the nth Fibonacci number using a closed formula:
This method directly calculates and prints the nth Fibonacci number using a more efficient mathematical formula. [Click here for more information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence)
<br />Key Formula: a(n) = (1/sqrt(5)) * [(1+sqrt(5))/2]^n - (1/sqrt(5)) * [(1-sqrt(5))/2]^n
<br /><br />![Fibonancci sequence formula](https://i.stack.imgur.com/tsuYw.png)
<br /><br />Directly calculates the nth Fibonacci number without needing to generate the entire sequence up to that point, making it computationally faster for large values of n. Provides a concise and precise way to obtain a specific Fibonacci number without unnecessary calculations.
<br />Example: To find the 10th Fibonacci number using Method 2:
<br />Apply the formula: a(10) = (1/sqrt(5)) * [(1+sqrt(5))/2]^10 - (1/sqrt(5)) * [(1-sqrt(5))/2]^10
<br />Calculate: a(10) â‰ˆ 55
