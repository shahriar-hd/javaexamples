## ArmStrong
Armstrong's number is a positive m-digit number which is equal to the sum of its m-digit powers, As in the example below : 
<br />1 : 1^1 = 1
<br />2 : 2^1 = 2
<br />153 : 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153
This program shows true or false.
## Automotphic
Automorphic's number is a number which second power ends with the number itself. For example, in the number 25 and 76, their second power (625 and 5776) ends with the number itself 25 and 76.
<br />25 : 25^2 = 625 → 6|26
<br />76 : 76^2 = 5776 → 57|76
<br />This program shows true or false.
## Peterson
Peterson's number is a number which sum of factorials of each digit is equal to itself. For example 145 is a Peterson number.
<br />145 : 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145
<br />This program shows true or false.
## Polindrome
Polindrome's number is a number that is equal to its inverse. As in the example below : 
<br />545 → 545
<br />This program shows true or false.
## Tech Number
Tech number is a number with even number of digits which second power of the sum of right and left half digit equals to itself. As example below :
<br />Tech number : 2025 → 20|25 → 20 + 25 → 45^2 = 2025
<br />Not tech number : 1213 → 12|13 → 25^2 = 625
